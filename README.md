# 🧾 Bill Calculator

This is a simple React app called **Bill Calculator** that helps you and a friend decide how much to tip after dining out, based on how each of you rated the service.

## 🚀 Features

* Enter the bill amount
* Select a tip percentage based on how **you** felt about the service
* Select a tip percentage based on how **your friend** felt about the service
* Calculates the **average tip percentage** from both opinions
* Displays the **total amount to be paid**, including tip
* A **Reset** button to start over

---


## 💻 How It Works

### Components

#### `App`

The main component that manages the state and renders the child components: `Bill`, `Tip`, and `Panel`.

State variables:

* `billAmount`: The total bill before tip.
* `myTip`: Your opinion on the tip percentage.
* `friendTip`: Your friend’s opinion on the tip percentage.

#### `Bill`

Allows the user to input the original bill amount.

```jsx
<Bill billAmount={billAmount} onEnterAmount={handleAmount} />
```

#### `Tip`

A reusable component that renders a dropdown to choose a tip percentage based on satisfaction level. Used for both your tip and your friend’s.

```jsx
<Tip tip={myTip} onChoose={handleMyTip}>
  What did you think of the service?
</Tip>
```

#### `Panel`

Calculates the **average tip percentage**, then:

* Computes the tip amount: `billAmount * averageTip`
* Displays the **total amount to pay**
* Includes a **Reset** button to clear all inputs

---

## ✨ Example Calculation

If:

* Bill = `$100`
* Your tip = `10%`
* Friend’s tip = `20%`

Then:

* Average tip = `15%`
* Tip amount = `$15`
* Total to pay = `$115`

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* React (with Hooks)
